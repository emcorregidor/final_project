#*Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time* (Opitz & Degner, 2012)

- Different sense of emotionality in a personâ€™s first (L1) and second language (L2).
- **Participants**: 33 bilinguals (FR-GE).
- **Task**: Lexical Monitoring Task (Yes/No Decision).
- **EEG Recording**: Data recorded while processing pleasant, unpleasant and neutral words in L1 and L2. Differences in processing recorded through the early posterior negativity (EPN).
- **Results**: the affective valence of L2 words is processed in a less immediate way due to delayed lexical access; interference in a highly integrated L1/ L2 mental lexicon."

##Research Questions & Hypothesis

**RQ1**: Are emotion concepts in the L2 processed later and less accurately than in the L1?

**H1**: Accuracy in L1 will be greater than accuracy in L2; latency will be greater when performing the task in the L2 than in the L1.

##Participants
- 150 Spanish-English bilinguals (75 women).

- Aged 25â€“35 years.

- Recruited among the administrative personnel from Rutgers University.

- Right-handed, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported no history of neurological or language disorders.

- **Late L2 learners (AoA = 12)**.

- By the time of testing...
    - **Highly proficient in Spanish.**
    - Mean of self-rated frequency of **weekly L2 use of 65%**.
    - At least one long stay (>6 months) in a L2 country.

##Tasks & Stimuli
**1. Language History Questionnaire**

Used to obtain information about the bilingual profile, L2 acquisition, L2 use and L2 frequency. It contained 7 multiple-choice questions, 8 questions with numerical scales and 5 open questions (total of 20 questions).

##Tasks & Stimuli
**2. Lexical Monitoring Task**

For the ENGLISH version of the task...
- Stimuli were obtained from an English words database (Imbault et al., 2020) were words were rated by participants based on valence and arousal. 
- From the database, the **50 words** with the highest valence level were chosen to be the **emotional words**. Similarly, the **50 words** with the lowest valance level were chosen to be the **non-emotional words**. 
- All words were nouns and were matched in word length, frequency of use. For the **pseudo-words**, **50 words** were created using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

##Tasks & Stimuli
**2. Lexical Monitoring Task**
For the SPANISH version of the task...
- Words were translated by 5 native speakers and those translations that matched were used.

The task was divided in five rounds, each with 30 trials (10 emotion words, 10 non-emotion words, 10 pseudo-words).

##EEG Recording

Early emotion processing is captured at the word level by the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN)...
- Elicited around 200-300 ms post-stimulus.
- Mapped in the occipital cortex.
- An index of rapid emotional attention (Luck, 2014).
- Here, use to capture response-accuracy and latency (and amplitude?).

##Statistical Analysis

**Dependent Variables**
- *Accuracy* in L1 AND L2 (right/wrong)
- *Latency* (ms, 280-430)

**Predictors**
- *Language* (l1, l2)
- *Word type* (emotion, non-emotion, and pseudo-words [only in the task, not for analysis])

**To keep in mind...**
- Accuracy is a binary outcome, a Yes/No decision AND a count vector.
- Latency does not range from -âˆž to âˆž.
- Predictors (language, word-type) are both categorical variables.

##Statistical Analysis: Accuracy Model
A generalized linear model + binary regression

*Accuracy* ~ *Task Language* + *Word Type*
```{r echo=TRUE}
mod_accuracy <- glm(
  accuracy ~ language + word_type, 
  data = data_tidy, 
  family = "binomial"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(mod_accuracy)
```

##Statistical Analysis: Latency Model
A general linear model (spoiler: plots are more fun)

*Latency* ~ *Task Language* + *Word Type*
```{r echo=TRUE}
mod_latency <- lm(
  accuracy ~ language + word_type, 
  data = data_tidy)
```

  ggplot(aes(x = language, y = latency, color = word_type)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4) +

##Considerations & Current Challenges
- Complexity of the model: **need** to understand it.
- Filter for pseudowords.
- Plots.
- Adding an slope?
  - For **accuracy**: *Accuracy* ~ *Task Language* x *Word Type* (+ 1 | item)
  - For **latency**: *Latency* ~ *Task Language* x *Word Type* (+ 1 | item)
- **Extra layers**: proficiency, amplitude.
